Probably the cheapest J arm on the market. Uses a bayonet style mount so the lockup is not as solid as a dovetail mount, however bayonet mounts are also usually less expensive that dovetail mounts.

Allows switching the monocular between each eye, but does not articulate to get the monocular up and out of the way
