Essentially a higher end version of the [[USGI J Arm]]. Has all the same adjustments but is made from machined aluminum instead of plastic, and uses a dovetail shoe for tighter lockup.

Available in both a straight leg version and a swept back version. The swept version can help get the monocular closer to your eye if you have a thick ballistic helmet or a mount without a lot of adjustment range.

These days most Wilcox products have been cloned by the Chinese to the point where the clones are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, and the real ones are insanely overpriced. Most people would probably be better off with a clone, but need to document which clones are the good ones.
