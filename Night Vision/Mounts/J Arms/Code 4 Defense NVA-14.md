Does not allow quickly switching between both eyes like the Wilcox J arm. Instead, the swivel mechanism allow you to articulate the monocular, moving it up out of the way without having to flip your mount up, or to tuck the monocular in closer to your helmet when flipped up.

To switch eyes you must remove the J arm from the mount and flip it over to the other dovetail. This sounds like a downside but in my experience this is more reliable than and less prone to accidental movement than double hinged arms like the [[Noisefighters AX-14]].
