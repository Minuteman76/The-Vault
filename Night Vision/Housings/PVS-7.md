Old style USGI biocular unit. A single tube intensifies a single image, and sends that same image to both eyes through a splitter prism.

These units have a lot of downsides and very few upsides. Because the same image is sent to both eyes, you get no depth perception. Because both eyes are receiving intensified light, neither eye remains adjusted to ambient darkness, and the unit needs to be flipped up when entering bright spaces because it obstructs both eyes. They are heavier than every monocular and even some binoculars. They use an old style bayonet mount instead of a modern dovetail mount which means they will be less stable on your face. Because the objective is in the middle of your face passive aiming through an optic isn't really possible.

The only real benefit these have over a monocular like the [[PVS-14]] is that they are less expensive. Also very rarely some individuals get eyestrain with a monocular due to the different light levels going to each eye, and in that case a biocular can possible resolve that eye strain.
