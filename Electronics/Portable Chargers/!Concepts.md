Most small portable chargers/ battery banks are advertised in terms of milliamp hours (mAh), however when trying to determine how many times a charger will charge a device, mAh does not tell the full story. You also need to know the voltage of the source and recipient battery, which can be multiplied by the mAh rating to get a milliwatt/watt hours rating. Many larger devices are already advertised in terms of watt hours.

Most portable chargers user standard lithium ion/ lithium polymer batteries, which operate at a nominal 3.7v.

So a 10,000 mAh battery bank at 3.7v has 37 Watt hours of energy.

Most electronics charge at about 85-90% efficiency, so count on 10-15% of the rated watt hours being lost.
