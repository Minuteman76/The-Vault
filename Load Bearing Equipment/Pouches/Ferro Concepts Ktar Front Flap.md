The real Ferro version sells for almost $90, however clones are available on Aliexpress for $15-40 depending on the current state of chinese tariffs.

The one sold under the "OPHIDIAN" brand that I tested has excellent stitching and magazine retention strength, strong enough that I felt confident removing the retention bungees. The multicam pattern is not a perfect match to real multicam, but it's close enough. Because the pattern is not exactly the same color, it does appear slightly brighter than real muticam fabric when hit with direct, high intensity IR illumination, but it does not "glow" like cheap webbing on other chinese pouches can. 

Without having a real KTAR to compare it to I can't say definitively that it's "Just As Good" as the real one, but I will say it feels solid enough that it should be good enough for anyone who isn't MIL or LEO, and it's probably good enough for them as well.
