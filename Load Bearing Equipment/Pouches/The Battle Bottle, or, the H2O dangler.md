This is a DIY pouch designed by Minuteman. It's designed to hold a small to medium diameter water bottle, such as a Smartwater 1L or any disposable 500ml bottle underneath the rear plate bag of most plate carriers, similar to commercial pouches like the [[Ferro Concepts Mini Dangler]] or [[Ferro Concepts Roll1 Trauma Pouch]].

The reasoning behind this is that most people currently carry their water in a bladder attached to the back of the rear plate bag. A bladder lets you carry more water for sustained missions, but it makes it difficult or impossible to wear a backpack, the bladder pouches are prone to snagging on rifle slings, and personally I find drinking out of a hydration tube to be annoying. It's also generally easier to refill water bottles in the field than it is to refill bladders, and water bottles like the Smartwater bottle come threaded with the exact right size threads to use water filters like the [[Sawyer Squeeze filter]].

This pouch will probably be most useful to people setting up their plate carrier for homestead defense or other mostly static missions. It's probably not great for people that have to wear a plate carrier inside a vehicle, or for extremely long recon style missions where you need multiple days of sustainment. This is just meant to keep a small amount of water on the carrier for emergencies or in case you are pressed into an unexpected mission and need to venture further from your homestead than you expected.

I recommend using this pouch with the 1L sized Smartwater bottle because of the aforementioned filter compatibility, they are exceeding lightweight for their capacity, and the long and skinny form factor makes it tuck under the plate well. Also most water purification tablets are designed to be added to 1L of water, so you can add a few tablets to your first aid kit and get even more emergency sustainment potential.

To make the pouch you'll need four supplies:

https://www.wtfidea.com/hook-1-5-wide-milspec-black-coyote-brown-ranger-green-wolf-grey-velcro-brand-berry-compliant/ - Sold in 1 yard increments, each pouch needs 6"
https://www.wtfidea.com/loop-1-5-wide-milspec-black-coyote-brown-ranger-green-wolf-grey-velcro-brand-berry-compliant/ - Sold in 1 yard increments, each pouch needs 6"
You will also need some kind of thread, regular cotton thread will work fine since this pouch will not be carrying any heavy loads, but stronger thread like nylon or polyester is recommended.

Start by cutting off 10" of the elastic,
Cut off 6" of the hook tape
Cut off 6" of the loop tape

Fold the elastic in half in the same direction the fabric is rolled, giving you a 5" x 6" rectangle two layers thick.
Place the hook fabric on top of the elastic, with the 6" edge of the hook tape lined up with the cut edges of the elastic, and the hooks facing up.
Place the loop fabric under the elastic, in the same orientation and position as the hook fabric, with the loops facing down.
Sew all along the entire perimeter of the hook tape, going through both layers of the elastic and the loop tape on the other side.
Optionally, sew an X pattern through the hook and loop tape as well for extra strength.

Depending on your plate carrier, you may want to use slightly more than 10" of elastic. Some carrier have the velcro closure tucked way up inside the plate bag, and you may need to account for this extra distance or the elastic pouch will be too tight. The 10" design has been tested to work well with both the [[Crye Precision JPC 2.0]] and [[Defense Mechanisms MEPC]].
