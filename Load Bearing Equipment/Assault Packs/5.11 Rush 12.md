24L

Slightly overpriced for what is essentially a regular school backpack with some molle webbing on it, but the pocket layout is pretty good and the straps are well padded. It fits within the "personal item" size limit of most airlines.

There are aliexpress clones available but the clones cost almost as much as the real ones.
