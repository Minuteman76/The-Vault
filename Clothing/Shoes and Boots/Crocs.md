These are surprisingly utilitarian camp shoes, especially if you'll be camping around water. They retain zero moisture and dry extremely fast, fully enclose your toes so you won't stub them on a tree root in the middle of the night, and when worn with good socks are almost as comfortable as normal sneakers for longer walks. They'll also protect your feet from any unseen sharp object underwater like broken glass or torn aluminum cans.
