## Quick Start

This light has three main levels (High, Medium, and Low) and a beacon-strobe mode.

- When the light is Off:
    - One short-click turns on the light to High.
    - Two short-clicks turn on the light to Medium.
    - Three short-clicks turn on the light to beacon-strobe mode.
    - Press-and-hold (for over 0.6 seconds) turns on the light to Low andthen Medium and High. Release at the desired level.
- When the light is On, a short-click turns off the light.

## To use another sub-level

For each of the three main (High, Medium and Low) levels, there are two corresponding sub-levels, H1 and H2, M1 and M2, L1 and L2.

1. Go to a main level with short-clicks or press-and-hold
2. Double-click to toggle between the two sub-levels (i.e. between H1 and H2, M1 and M2, or L1 and L2)

The last sub-levels used in each main level are memorized and will come back on when you go back to that main level. Sub-level settings are memorized when the light is turned off and through battery changes.

## Programming the second sub-level

The first sub-levels (H1, M1, and L1) of each main level have fixed (none configurable) brightness. The second sub-levels (H2, M2 and L2) can be further programmed to different brightness levels.

1. Go to a main level with short-clicks or press-and-hold
2. Double-click 6 times to enter the programming mode for that main level
3. On subsequent double-clicks the light will cycle through different brightness levels in H2, M2 and L2.
4. When you have the choice you want, exit the programming mode by performing a short-click.

Second sub-level settings are memorized when the light is turned off and through the battery changes.

## **Changing levels after the light is On**

When the light is On, press-and-hold to cycle through Low, Medium and High. Release at the desired level. Note that the light always cycles from Low regardless which level you are currently in.

## Beacon and Strobes

The beacon-strobe mode can be accessed with 3 clicks when the light is Off. Once in the beacon-strobe mode, you can double-click to cycle through different types of beacons and strobes. Beacon-strobe settings are memorized when the light is turned off and through battery changes.

## Battery Indicator

This light uses (1 to 4) flashings of the main LED to give a rough estimate of the remaining capacity of the batteries. The battery indicator can be accessed with 4 short-clicks when the light is Off.

## Multiple UI Groups

This light comes with three UI groups, G5, G6, and G7. The G5, set as the factory default, can be selected with 5 clicks from Off, while G6 and G7 can be selected with 6 clicks and 7 clicks from Off respectively. UI group selections are memorized after the light is turned off and through battery changes.

In all three UI groups, from Off: 1-click to H (H1 or H2), 2-click to M (M1 or M2), press and hold to cycle from L (L1 or L2), and then to M and H.

In the G5 UI group, brightness levels of the H1, M1 and L1 are fixed, while the H2, M2 and L2 can be programmed. In the G6 and G7, all six (H1, H2, M1, M2, L1, and L2) modes can be programmed to any of the 12 available brightness levels. To program the G6 or G7:

1. Enter the G6 or G7 with 6 or 7 clicks from Off.
2. Double-click 6 times at H1, H2, â€¦ L2 to enter the programming mode for that level. Once in the programming mode, use double- click to go up one level and triple-click to go down one level. Use 1- click to exit the programming mode.
3. If needed, use 15, 18, and 21 clicks from Off, to reset to the factory default settings of the G5, G6, and G7 UI groups.
