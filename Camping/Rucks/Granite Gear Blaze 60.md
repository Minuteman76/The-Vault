Regularly goes on sale for about half off, don't pay full price unless you really need it immediately.

Relatively light at just 3 pounds, but still has an internal frame able to accommodate 50 pound loads. Not a true ultralight pack but far lighter than most "tactical" rucks while maintaining many of the same features. Available in dark, inconspicuous colors.
