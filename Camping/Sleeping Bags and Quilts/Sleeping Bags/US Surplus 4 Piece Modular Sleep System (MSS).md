Contains a black "Intermediate" mummy bag rated to -10F, a green "patrol" bag rated for 30F, a woodland camo Goretex bivy sack, and a black compression carrying bag. Combined the system is rated down to -30F.

The whole system is extremely bulky and heavy, weighing almost 10 pounds on it's own. These used to be very affordable at surplus stores but are now $400+. The mummy style sleeping bags can be snug and may not fit taller individuals. This effect is amplified by trying to fit one sleeping bag inside the other if you're trying to reach that -30F rating.

The included bivy is very heavy duty, but suffers from the same condensation problems as all bivys. The Goretex fabric does a poor job of allowing moisture from your breathe to escape and it builds up in the bivy, which will lead to you waking up cold and wet.

There are cheaper, lighter, and more effective options on the civilian market. Most people don't need a -30F sleeping bag anyways. Skip this unless you can get it for very cheap and just plan to use the green patrol bag.
