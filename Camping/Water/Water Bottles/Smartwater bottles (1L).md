These are available at almost any grocery store or gas station. They are meant to be disposable bottles but they hold up fine for many season, they aren't flimsy like most smaller 500ml bottles.

The threads for the cap perfectly line up with all of the Sawyer Squeeze water filters, and the bottles are squeezable to push water through the filters.

I typically carry two to hold clean, filtered water, and a third to always fill with dirty water to squeeze through the filter.
