The marlinespike hitch is a rope knot that is often used with a rope that is already attached at one end to something in order to gain better purchase or grip on the rope for tightening. The marlinespike (or rod, stick, tool handle or any long and thin object) that has been inserted into the knot can be used as a handle to pull very hard on the rope.

The knot can also be tied in a series of parallel knots down two side-by-side ropes with rods attached through both knots to be used as a makeshift ladder. The load that is put on the rods (or whatever is being used as the marlinspike) should only be from the standing side of the knot. The knot is commonly used in rigging hammock suspension systems and "whoopie slings".
