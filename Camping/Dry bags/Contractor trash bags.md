A cheaper alternative to dedicated dry bags is to use a heavy duty 2-3 mil contractor trash bag as a pack liner. These are much more durable than regular garbage bags but still don't last forever, eventually they will wear out and start to form holes. They aren't completely waterproof, if the bag falls out of a boat or something and gets fully submerged water can still get in through the opening, but they are generally good enough to keep your pack contents dry through heavy rain.
