This bag appears to have been discontinued and replaced with the [[Sea to Summit Evac Compression Dry Bag]]. Since it's compressible, It's a great bag for holding sleeping bags or quilts if you'll be hiking near water or in rainy conditions. It won't keep water out indefinitely but it should keep your insulation dry in the event the bag falls into the water.

One downside is that when compressed it tends to turn sort of basketball shaped, which leads to a lot of wasted space inside the bag.
