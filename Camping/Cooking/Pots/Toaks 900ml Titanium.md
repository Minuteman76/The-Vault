Weight is with lid and padded carrying bag. Bag has a sewn in sleeve sized to fit a mini bic lighter.

900ml is probably overkill for most single serving applications, however it does mean the pot is just big enough to hold one of the big 230g iso-butane canisters, so it takes up almost no more space than just the fuel for a butane stove.
