It's definitely good to know multiple ways to start a fire, but why put more work into it than you have to. These cost and weigh almost nothing and are available everywhere. They aren't waterproof, and will stop working for a while if they get submerged in water, but even then you can just blow on them for a few minutes and they will work again, or just pack a few since they are so lightweight. 

You can wrap them in duct tape to have a little bit of tape on hand for repairs, or light a small section of the tape on fire to get a bigger fire going, duct tape makes surprisingly good tinder, but I'm sure it's not very environmentally friendly to do so.
