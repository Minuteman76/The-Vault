Material: 40D Nylon

Available in 11 or 12 foot lengths. Longer is more comfortable for taller people, 11 feet is plenty for ~6' tall users.

Includes a static structural ridgeline so the sag is fixed regardless of suspension tension or angle.

Bugnet is detachable with zippers for comfort or to replace in the event the bug net is damaged. There is a small mesh pocket at one end to hold the balled up bug net when not in use.
