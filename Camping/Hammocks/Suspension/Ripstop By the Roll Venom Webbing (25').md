EXTREMELY strong and lightweight webbing material, ideal for use with a [[Becket Hitch (Hammock Knot)]] suspension setup. Sold in 25' lengths, you can cut it in half and tie a [[Bowline]] in one end of each half to end up with two ~12.5 foot straps.

Two main drawbacks to this webbing:

1. It's so thin and slippery it can't be used with any kind of cinch buckle suspension, there's just not enough material for the buckles to bite down on.
2. It bunches up if any kind of pressure is applied, ESPECIALLY if it's tied into a knot, and it has to be sort of massaged out before it will lay flat again, which takes forever
