For a hammock to work it obviously needs to be held off the ground. When camping the most common support method is to tie the hammock to two solid trees. However, using regular rope for this will damage the trees bark by concentrating the weight on a very small area. This will work just fine in an emergency, but violates LNT principles.

Instead, webbing straps are used, typically about 1 inch wide. 1 inch doesn't sound like much but it's enough to avoid damaging the tree.
