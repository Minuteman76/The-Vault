These are substantially lighter than regular polyester straps, but not as light as the [[Ripstop By the Roll Venom Webbing (25')]]. These are also too thin to reliably use with cinch buckles, but they don't bunch up like the venom straps. They strike a good balance if you want to use a [[Becket Hitch (Hammock Knot)]] for your suspension.
