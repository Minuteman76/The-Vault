Very simple to use, just wrap the strap around a tree, pass one end of the chain through the loop at the other end, and clip your hammock carabiner to one of the loops. 

Compared to more modern suspension setups these are bulky and heavy, since they have over twice the amount of material necessary to hold the hammock.

They also lack adjustability, since you can only adjust in full loop increments, there's no way to go up or down by half a loop.
