Perhaps the most minimalist hammock suspension method, all you need is a length of webbing, or rope in an emergency.

Tie a [[Bowline]] in one end of the webbing, wrap it around the tree, and push the other end through the loop of the bowline.

Pass the strap through the continuous loop of the hammock and pull to adjust hammock height. Once the hammock is at the desired height, tie the becket hitch knot right above the continuous loop.

To release, just pull the loose end of the strap, and the knot comes apart.

This method has the benefit of working with almost any rope or webbing, including stuff like ultralight UHMWPE webbing which is too thin and slippery for cinch buckles. However, the downside of this method is it's not adjustable, every time you want to adjust the height you'll need to re-tie the becket hitch. It's also difficult to get the height just right because the knot tends to slip a little bit when you first tie it.
