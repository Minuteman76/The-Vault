These are effectively a length of rope with a permanent loop at each end which can be shortened or lengthened to adjust the hang of the hammock.

These are generally the lightest possible suspension with an infinite adjustment mechanism, but are more complicated to use than other systems.

Since these are rope and not webbing, you will need some kind of short "tree hugger" straps to attach to the tree to prevent damaging the bark. Then you will need a method of attaching the whoopie sling to the tree hugger strap, commonly a [[Marlin Spike Hitch]] is used.

Then you will need a way to attach the hammock to the other end of the whoopie sling, usually a carabiner or another Marlin Spike Hitch.

Lastly, because of the way these slings are constructed, it's possible for the adjustment to slip and loosen up if you do not "milk the bury" every time it is adjusted.
