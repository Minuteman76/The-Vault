Extremely easy to use, and fast to set up and tear down. No knots to learn, just pull the webbing through the cinch buckle until the hammock is at the desired height.

One downside to this suspension is the cinch buckles require relatively thick, soft straps to bite into. Regular nylon webbing works fine, as does Dutchware's "Spider" blended webbing, however it will NOT work with thin, slippery webbing like the Venom UHMWPE ultralight webbing https://ripstopbytheroll.com/products/venom-uhmwpe-ultralight-webbing
