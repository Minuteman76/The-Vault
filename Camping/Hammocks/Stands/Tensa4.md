One of the smallest, lightest hammock stands on the market. Uses tensioned straps and counterbalanced forces for support instead of relying entirely on freestanding strength of the aluminum poles.

Takes a very long time to set up and adjust, 20+ minutes even if you know what you are doing. Despite how it looks it is extremely stable once set up.
