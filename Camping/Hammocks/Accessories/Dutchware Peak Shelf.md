Just a big pocket for the foot end of the hammock that can hold bulky items while you sleep. Great for sweatshirts, base layers, dirty clothes storage, etc. You do need to disassemble one of the gathered ends of the hammock to install it which can be a bit fidly, but once it's installed it's soft enough that you can just ball it up with the hammock when you back up the rest of the hammock.
