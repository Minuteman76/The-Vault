A simple phone clip that attaches to a hammock ridgeline. Great for watching movies in your hammock as you fall asleep without having to hold your phone in front of your face. It's a luxury item without much real practical use but a reasonably lightweight one. It does take up more space than you would think due to the oblong shape, but it can be disassembled to make it lay a bit more flat.
