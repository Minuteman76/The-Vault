Price is for a 4 pack.

These toggles are a great alternative to tying a [[Trucker's Hitch]] on the working end of a continuous tarp suspension. They act similarly to a [[Dutchware Wasp]], but in my experience these are easier to adjust, the knot to lock them in place is easier to remember, and it's easier to pull apart when you want to take it down. 

Just lock the toggle in place somewhere between the end of the tarp and the tree, loop the ridgeline around the tree, pull it tight, and wrap the free end of the ridgeline around the locked toggle 2-3 times.
