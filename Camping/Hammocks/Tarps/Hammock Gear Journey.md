Like a hex tarp but with added "doors" on the head and foot end in case of heavy rain and winds. Needs some kind of solution for managing the doors, if you just leave them loose they'll flutter in the wind. This video shows one method for managing the doors, you can also use mitten hooks instead of buckles: https://youtu.be/TaDq-FhOC2U?t=169
