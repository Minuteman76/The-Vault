Expensive for a bump helmet, but it does have a nice suspension and shroud. The stock pads are a bit lackluster, highly recommend upgrading with [[4D Hyve Pads]]. The 3.0 rails also aren't great, it seems like the industry has pretty much standardized on the ARC rail standard, but you can get the [[Team Wendy EXFIL Peltor Quick Release Adapters]] for stuff like ear pro.
